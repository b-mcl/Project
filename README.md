This was a University project to monitor plants via a TKinter app.
Using a Particle Photon 3 microcontroller, a soil sensor + a temperature and humidity sensor it would monitor the plant to alert when water levels in the soil were too low, or when temperature/humidity levels were outside an ideal window
Functionality was added to receive SMS notifications when the plant was in danger
